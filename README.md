# OASIS Teledentinistry Mobile Application
___
## Introduction

The OASIS Teledentistry Mobile App project builds on the foundation laid by the E17 batch,
who previously developed a web application as part of the OASIS research initiative. This
mobile application aims to expand and enhance the functionalities of the original system,
providing dentists with a more accessible platform for teleconsultations, patient entry
management, and secure medical data storage.
The primary goal of this project is to enable dentists to perform consultations remotely while
maintaining a comprehensive and user-friendly system for managing patient records. By
transitioning to a mobile platform, the project seeks to meet the growing demand for on-the-go
healthcare solutions. Developed with a Flutter-Dart front end and a Spring Boot backend, the
app ensures reliability, scalability, and robust data security.
This report outlines the continuation of the OASIS research efforts, detailing the functional and
non-functional requirements, key use cases, testing methodologies, and feedback received.
By integrating advanced mobile technology, the OASIS Teledentistry Mobile App takes a
significant step towards revolutionizing remote dental care and ensuring seamless usability for
dental professionals.
